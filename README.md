# TicTacToe
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! This project features a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface, making it easy for players of all ages to enjoy.

The webpage includes a reset button to start a new game, allowing players to play multiple rounds without refreshing the page. To enhance the gaming experience, background music and sound effects have been added. The background music sets the mood of the game while sound effects play when a checkbox is clicked and when the game is over.

The game also features a display that shows the current player's turn and the winner of the game. This makes it easy for players to keep track of the game's progress and know when the game has ended. The game is also fully responsive, meaning it will look great on any device, whether you're playing on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

Overall, this Tic Tac Toe game is an enjoyable and easy-to-play game that will keep you entertained for hours on end.

I hope you enjoy playing this Tic Tac Toe game as much as I enjoyed creating it. You can use the code in this repository as a starting point for your own Tic Tac Toe game or other web development projects. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
